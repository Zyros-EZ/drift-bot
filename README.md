## Features 

### 👥 Party Listing

When using `/party-create` command, the bot create a new party list and it'll post it on the cannel defined by the `/config` command (`party-listing` by default).  
It'll also listen to reactions so members can join or leave groups.  
To make use of this feature, make sure that the bot has enough permissions to the configured channel.  

**Examples**:
```bash
/party-create name: Cooking contest
/party-create name: Pirate King description: If it's your first time, it's okay date: Tomorrow 8PM level: 40 slots: 10
/party-update id: 20 date: 02/04/2020
```
